#Code Explain for Main file

This code is the main class for an application that analyzes log data. It defines a main method that is executed when the application is run.

1)The code declares and initializes several variables, including a fileName variable that contains the path to the log file to be analyzed, and a keyboard Scanner object that is used to read input from the user.

2)The code enters an infinite do-while loop that displays a menu of options to the user and prompts them to enter a number corresponding to the option they want to select.

3)The code uses a switch statement to determine which option the user has selected, and it calls the appropriate method to perform the desired analysis on the log file.

4)The options are:

	-Total number of completed and ended jobs by months
	-Total number of job by partition
	-Total number of errors by user
	-Total number of jobs by partition for each month
	-Total number of nodes usage per partition
	-Execution Time
	-The code also checks for -1 entered by user which is for exit. If -1 is entered, the code displays a message thanking the user and exits the application.

5)The code also clears the console after each selection with the help of `new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c", "cls
