#Code Explain for Partition

This code is reading a log file with the file name passed to the method "jobByPartitions" as an argument.
It's counting the number of jobs that were scheduled on different partitions.
The partitions it's counting are "cpu-epyc", "cpu-opteron", "gpu-v100s", "gpu-k40c", "gpu-titan" and "gpu-k10".
After reading the log file, it's printing the total number of jobs scheduled on each partition.
Then it's sorting the partitions based on the number of jobs scheduled on each partition and printing the partition
with the highest and lowest number of scheduled jobs.


--------------------------
This Java code reads a file and counts the number of jobs that are allocated to different partitions.
It uses a BufferedReader to read the file line by line and splits each line into an array of strings using the split() method.
It then uses a series of if-statements to check for specific keywords that indicate a job is allocated to a specific partition,
and increments a counter for that partition.
It also sorted the partition with the highest number of jobs allocated to it and printed it out.
