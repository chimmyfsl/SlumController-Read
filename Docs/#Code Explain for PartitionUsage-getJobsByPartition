This code reads in a file named "fileName" and processes it line by line using a Scanner object.
It splits each line by space and separates the first element by "-",
to get the month in String format and convert it to an integer.
If the length of the split line is 7 and the 3rd element is "Allocate",
it increments a total counter.
It then checks if the month digit is equal to "b" and if it is,
it splits the 6th element by "=" to get the partition and increments the corresponding partition count.
If "b" is equal to 12, it sets the month to "December".
If the digit is not equal to "b", it displays the month, the partition count, and increments "b" by 1.
It then resets the partition count and starts counting for the next month.
