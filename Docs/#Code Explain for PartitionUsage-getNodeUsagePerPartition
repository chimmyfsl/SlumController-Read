This code reads a file specified by the fileName parameter, then uses a BufferedReader to read the file line by line.
It uses the split method to separate the lines into different parts, and then checks if the parts contain the word "Allocate".
If they do, it splits the line again to check the partition and the node,
and increments a counter for that specific partition and node in an array.
It then repeats this process for each partition and node specified in the arrays partition, nodeCPU, and nodeGPU.
It seems like this code is used to get the usage statistics of each node in each partition.
